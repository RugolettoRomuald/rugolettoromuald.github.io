1
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
All we propose through this project is a dreamlike and colourful universe.

2
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The player takes the role of the blue cat (Vega) and will be responsible for eliminating enemies throughout the level.

3
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The second cat (Gen) will be the guarantee of the player's level and progress.

4
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
When enemies approach Gen, her stress indicator rises, that’s slowing her down and stopping her if there are too many enemies.

5
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Vega then has to clear the way for Gen to keep moving forward.

6
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.000
By hitting repeatedly, the player loads skills that make it easier for him to get rid of these opponents.

7
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
4 skills are available: the Magic Stick, the Anathor Flame, the Shell and the God Mod.

8
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
We had not finished implementing the score for the 2018 Games Festival.

9
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The shell also reduces Gen's stress indicator.

10
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:36.000
When the stress indicator is fully filled, Vega has a chance to save Gen and not lose his level progress.

11
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
He goes into hell and has to save Gen before it is too late.

12
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The player must then move as efficiently as possible and use the enemies as support.
