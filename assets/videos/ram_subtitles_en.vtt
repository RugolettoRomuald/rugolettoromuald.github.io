1
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
A geek, corrupted applications..

2
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
No superpower, but great responsibilities.

3
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You play Adam, a 15-year-old teenager, who unintentionally finds himself in the midst of epic adventures.

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
He was sleeping when his phone started emitting a strong light.

5
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Pulled by force into a galaxy endangered by Neozonia,

6
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Adam will have to explore, infiltrate, sabotage, beat up.

7
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In short, saving planets!

8
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Nozama, the first planet you arrive on is under a totalitarian regime set up by Neozonia.

9
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The population is deprived of its most fundamental rights such as freedom of expression or freedom of movement,

10
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
will rebel especially thanks to the action of memers and Adam will help them.

11
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This character (Ludwig) will help Adam escape the guards throughout his adventure.

11
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Neozonia's policy is to replace all freedom of expression, particularly the memes with advertising.

12
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Through this project, our primary objective is to provide an entertaining gaming experience.

13
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
However, we used it as an opportunity to caricature Amazon.

14
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We wanted the people of Nozama to be robots to show the dehumanization of employees.
 
15
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You can learn more about their living conditions through the dialogues or by finding memes placarded in the city.

16
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Throughout the adventure, references to Amazon are abundant but deliberately discreet (drones, factory, prime, robots, Blackfriday...).

17
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000
During the drone race, the player must fly with the gyroscope, avoiding the speed bumps (red) and getting the accelerators (green).

18
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Reaching the first place in the drone race unlocks the rest of the adventure.

19
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Adam escaped by avoiding the guards again with the help of Ludwig.

20
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
He arrives in Blackfriday, a bar that houses the shelter of the rebellious memers.

21
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
In this gaming phase, Adam must reach the factory without being spotted.

22
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
You can always use the compass at the top left of the screen to find your way.

23
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
The door in front of Adam is only open because no guard is chasing him.

24
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We can see that it closed again as soon as the guard saw us.

25
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It is then necessary to evade him, to be able to pass on to the next part of the adventure.

26
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Adam infiltrates the factory, to place a bomb.

27
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Thrown out of the factory by the explosion, Adam will have to escape the planet before Neozonia gives him a hard time.

28
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Adam manages to escape Neozonia after completing his mission and flees to new planets to save.
